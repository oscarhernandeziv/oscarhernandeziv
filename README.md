Iâ€™m Oscar, a professional data analyst with three years' experience in operations, six in customer service and hospitality, and several technical projects. My skills include BI analytics, Excel and Sheets, SQL, data visualization and storytelling. Now, I am eager to leverage my data analysis and visualization skills sphere to drive growth and optimize processes for the right company.

Currently, my role with Stumptown Coffee Roasters has allowed me to not only master my skills with cross-functional teamwork, communication, and problem solving, but also with data-driven decision making and process optimization in the operations and fulfillment space. With Stumptown, I have improved production efficiency by 15% through data-driven predictive maintenance techniques, reducing unplanned downtime and increasing OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), and implemented cost-saving measures to optimize raw material usage and minimize waste, resulting in a 10% reduction in overall production costs.

In August 2023, I enrolled in the TripleTen 4-month Business Intelligence Analyst program. The curriculum covered Google Sheets (Pivot tables, VLOOKUP, VBA), data visualization (Tableau, PowerBI), SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

Some facts about me:

ðŸ“¸ I have experience as a freelance photographer, shooting and editing professional portrait photos for clients and friends.
ðŸŒŠ I love swimming! Spending time on the river is a vital part of my Portland summers and a daily gym ritual when it's cold out.
ðŸ¥˜ I am an avid cook who takes inspiration from my upbringing as a latino who grew up in New Orleans.
ðŸŽ¯ My goals for 2023: landing my dream job in data. And getting a cat!
