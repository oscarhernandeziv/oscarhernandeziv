My skills include BI analytics, Excel and Google Sheets, SQL, data visualization and storytelling.

In winter 2023, I completed the [TripleTen BI Analyst](https://tripleten.com/bi/) program. In summer 2024, I started on a journey to properly learn to code by enrolling in the [ui.dev](https://ui.dev) suite of Javascript and React courses, aiming to pair my analyst skills with well-crafted web apps. 

Some facts about me:

- ðŸ“¸ I have experience as a freelance photographer, shooting and editing professional portrait photos for clients and friends.
- ðŸŒŠ I love swimming! Spending time on the river is a vital part of my Portland summers and a daily gym ritual when it's cold out.
- ðŸ¥˜ I am an avid cook who takes inspiration from my upbringing as a latino who grew up in New Orleans.
- ðŸŽ¯ My goals for 2024: Dive deeper into data analysis and web development!
